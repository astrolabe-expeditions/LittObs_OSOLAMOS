    """
    The update_flag_wake_up function is used to update the flag and
    index values for each channel. The function takes in a flag, current_flag,
    and threshold value as inputs. The function then updates the flag_value array
    by setting all the values that are equal to True in current_flag to 0. It then
    sets all the values that are equal to True in flag_value (which will be any
    peaks detected) to 1 more than their previous value. If this new value is greater
    than a threshold, it sets both its index and flag_value
    back down to - 1 (so it can start over).

    :param flag: Keep track of the previous state of the flag
    :param current_flag: Indicate the index of the current flag
    :param threshold: Determine how many samples must pass before the flag is reset
    :return: The flag and the index of the changed flags
